Altimeter
=========

Altimeter is a system to scan AWS resources across multiple AWS
Organizations and Accounts and link resources together in a graph
which can be queried to discover security and compliance issues.

Altimeter outputs RDF files which can be loaded into a triplestore
such as AWS Neptune and Blazegraph.

This documentation is divided into 3 parts:

`User Documentation`_ - How to use Altimeter to scan your AWS accounts and query relationships.

`Developer Documentation`_ - Documentation for developers who are interested in extending Altimeter's capabilities,
specifically graphing additional AWS resource types or additonal fields on existing resource types.

`API Documentation`_ - auto-generated API documentation.

    modules
    altimeter.aws
    altimeter.core

Altimeter is divided into two packages - `aws` and `core`.

The :doc:`aws <altimeter.aws>` package contains AWS-specific access and scanning code for AWS-specific
resources.

The :doc:`core <altimeter.core>` package contains generic graphing code which is used by the `aws` package but could be
used by other graph-generating systems.
